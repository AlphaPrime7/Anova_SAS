# Anova_SAS
- Anova analysis using SAS and SPSS
- Between group differences are the result of experimental treatment + experimental error (often sampling techniques or other factors that made the categories different)
- Within group differences are merely the effect of experimental error (sampling techniques)
- The F-test (equality of variance) must not be confused with the F-ratio (Between vs within).
